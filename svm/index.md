## Problem Formulation

Classifying with good margin is always preferred over small margin

## `Fiding W with large margin`
Let $x_{n}$ be the nearest point to the hyperpalne, $w^{T}$ x + b = 0.

Let  |$w^{T}$ $x_{n}$ + b| = 1

Lets take x' and x'' be two points lie on plane $w^{T}$ x + b = 0, note $w^{T}$ is a normal vector to plane.

$w^{T}$ x' + b = 0 \
$w^{T}$ x'' + b = 0

$w^{T}$(x' - x'') = 0
