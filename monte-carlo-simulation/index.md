# Monte - Carlo Simulation

In this blog, I am going to use simulation for solving famous probability question.

## The Famous Monte-Hall Problem

## The expected distance between two points randomly sampled inside a unit square

## Estimate the value of pi

## Three points are chosen on the unit circle. What is the probability that the origin lies inside the triangle determined by the four points?

## What is the probability that a random chord length is greater than radius?

## N letters are randomly put into envelops, On an average how many letters are put into its own envelop?

## If a stick is broken at random points, what is the expected length of smaller one, ratio of bigger/smaller?
