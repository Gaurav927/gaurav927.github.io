# Monte - Carlo Simulation

In this blog, I am going to use simulation for solving famous probability question.
We are going to use python's random number generator to solve the question.

Its a two step process

* Generate the sample 
* Count the relevent samples

## The Famous Monte-Hall Problem

## One hundred people line up to board an airplane. Each has a boarding pass withassigned seat. However, the first person to board has lost his boarding pass and takes a random seat. After that, each person takes the assigned seat if it is unoccupied, and one of unoccupied seats at random otherwise. What is the probability that the last person to board gets to sit in his assigned seat?

## The expected distance between two points randomly sampled inside a unit square

## Estimate the value of pi, euler's number (e)

## Three points are chosen on the unit circle. What is the probability that the origin lies inside the triangle determined by the three points?

## What is the probability that a random chord length is greater than radius?

## N letters are randomly put into envelops, On an average how many letters are put into its own envelop?

## If a stick is broken at random points, what is the expected length of smaller one, ratio of bigger/smaller?

## A railroads number it's locamotive in order 1, 2, .... N, One day we see a locomotive 60, Guess the number of locomotives company has?

It is confirmed that, the number of locomotive or the value of N is atleast 60 (since we have a visual proof of this). It might happen there are 
total 60 locomotives and we saw the 60th one

the accepted range of N in based on visual proof is (60, 61, .... inf)

E[number of locomotives] = 60* P(60 locomotives) + 61* P(61 locomotives and we saw the 60th one) +
